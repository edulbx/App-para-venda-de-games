Fisrt of all pay attention to the versions and errors because they are hell: 

1. For solving a possible error with the bootsnap use this tutorial that I found here https://qiita.com/Kage_/items/08a0e364ae478fe6f15c kudos to whom update this.
2. For solving a possible error while installing the dependencies the easier way is to use bundle install or update, or install all the gemns yourself with the especified version on the gem file. 
3. For problems with postgres use this https://gorails.com/forum/rake-db-create-fails-while-following-windows-11-rails-setup-guide
